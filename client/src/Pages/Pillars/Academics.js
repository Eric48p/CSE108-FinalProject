            Our role in Academics is to provide gratuitous resources to build a strong team of Engineering Student Cohort at SHPE UC Merced; as college students, school comes first. We all have been in the position of struggling academically but we don't have to struggle alone. Whether you would like to be a tutor, be a tutee, or just looking for a study group, please contact our Academic Chair, <strong><a className="hyperLink" href="/ExecutiveBoard" target="_blank">Carlos Montano</a></strong>.
